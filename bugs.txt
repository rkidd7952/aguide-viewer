[ ] Bug 1: Window scroll doesn't update when changing nodes

This bug needs two linked pages that overflow the browser window

1. Scroll down first page to find link
2. Click link
3. Second page is scrolled at same point as first

The viewer needs to save the current scroll point in history, then
scroll to 0, 0 in the new page.

Work in progress on bug_1_scroll

Reproducible on PPaint.guide (Project menu)
