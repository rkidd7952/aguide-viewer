[ ] Bug 2: Window scroll doesn't update when changing nodes

https://github.com/rkidd7952/aguide-viewer/issues/2

This bug needs two linked pages that overflow the browser window

1. Scroll down first page to find link
2. Click link
3. Second page is scrolled at same point as first

The viewer needs to save the current scroll point in history, then
scroll to 0, 0 in the new page.

Work in progress on bug_1_scroll

Reproducible on PPaint.guide (Project menu)



[ ] Bug 3: Package and submit extension to Chrome store

https://github.com/rkidd7952/aguide-viewer/issues/3

Package and submit the extension to the Chrome store to be
signed. This will make installation on Chrome/Chromium much easier.



[ ] Bug 4: Submit extension to Firefox Add-on repo

https://github.com/rkidd7952/aguide-viewer/issues/4

Once the extension is stable, submit for inclusion in the official
Firefox Add-on site to make installation easier.



[ ] Bug 5: Add tooltip to links that require more than a click to open

https://github.com/rkidd7952/aguide-viewer/issues/5

In Firefox, a link to a local external document may not work as
expected.  Firefox blocks links that refer to a URL starting with
file:/// as a security measure.  These links can be opened using a
workaround (right click, open the link in a new tab or window, then
reload the new tab to render).

The viewer should add a tool tip to explain this when hovering over an
affected link.

To reproduce, see testdata/external_links.guide



[ ] Bug 6: Links to external documents may not work as expected in Firefox

https://github.com/rkidd7952/aguide-viewer/issues/6

Links from one AmigaGuide document to another may not work as expected
when browsing local files (file:/// URL) in Firefox.  Firefox blocks
direct links to local files from the extension as a security measure.

To open such a link, right click, open the link in a new tab or
window, then reload the new tab to render.

Filing this issue for documentation.  I'm not sure anything can be
done to fix this.



[ ] Bug 7: Links to external documents that use device names don't work

https://github.com/rkidd7952/aguide-viewer/issues/7

A link to an external document that uses a device name doesn't work.

To reproduce, see testdata/external_links.guide



[X] Bug 8: Extension is being activated if submitted search form
contains ".guide"

Filed by amigaosz

I hope I didn't somehow overlook that this issue has already been reported.

What I noticed: If I enter ".guide" in the search term on duckduckgo.com or Google or actually in any other search form on the site and send the request, the extension is automatically activated. I'm using Firefox 113.0.1 (64-bit) on Linux Mint.

By the way: Great plugin, I've been looking for something like this for a long, long time. Thank you so much for the great work! :)
