v0.2 2023-May-21
 - The extension is less aggressive when intercepting URLs that
   include the string .guide.  The detection methods are now
   configurable and can be turned off if they cause problems.  Please
   report an issue if the default configuration causes a problem.  All
   auto detection can be turned off and the extension manually
   triggered if desired.

 - Links that require more than a simple click to open now have
   tooltips explaining what to do.
