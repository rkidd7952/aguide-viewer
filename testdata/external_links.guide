@node main "external_links.guide"

This document tests links to other AmigaGuide documents

A link to a node in this AmigaGuide document (an internal link) should
always work.

@{"Internal link" Link "internal_node"}

A link to a node in another AmigaGuide document (an external link) may
require special interaction on Firefox.  When viewing this guide
locally (file:/// URL), Firefox will block the link to another local
file.  This external link would work if this guide was being viewed
from the web (http[s]:// URL).

@{"Relative external link" Link "another.guide/main"}

A link to another AmigaGuide document that uses an absolute path
(device/volume name) almost certainly doesn't work.

@{"Relative external link" Link "Work:another.guide/main_abs"}

@endnode

@node "internal_node" "Internal Node"

Success!  The internal link works!

@endnode
